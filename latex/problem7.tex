Using a 1D random walk. If the walker starts at $x = i$, I will show how many distinct random walks there are that reach $x = j$ after $t$ time steps. Let $P$ be the number of positive steps taken and $N$ be the number of negative steps taken.

Because the walker must take $t$ steps and they must be either positive or negative,
\[
    P + N = t
    \addtag
\]

I am also only looking at the number of steps that reach $(j - i)$ (the distance traveled) steps away,
\[
    P - N = j - i 
    \addtag
\]

The number of possible random walks is also given by $N(i, j, t)$ is,
\[
    N(i, j, t) = 
        \binom{t}{P}
    \addtag
\]

Simplifying the equations starting with (2) and then substituting into (1) and then (3).
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
    P - N = j - i
    P  = j - i + N
    P - j + i = N
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\[
    N = P - j + i
    \addtag
\]

Substituting (5) into the equation from (1)
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
    P + N = t
    P + (P - j + i) = t
    2P - j + i = t
    2P = t + j - i
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\[
    P = (t + j - i) / 2
    \addtag
\]

\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
    N(i, j, t) =
        \binom{t}{P} \\
    N(i, j, t) =
        \binom{t}{(t + j - i) / 2}
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

I find these results incredibly strange. The results for the $\alpha$ values come out to be exactly the same as the results for $\gamma$ from the ccdf in problem 2. I would have expected them to follow the rule layed out in class.
\[
    \alpha =
    \frac{1}{\gamma - 1}
    \addtag
\]

I am not sure which error lead me to this situation.
